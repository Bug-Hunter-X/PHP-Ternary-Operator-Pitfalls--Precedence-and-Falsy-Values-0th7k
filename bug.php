This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the ternary operator within an array assignment.  The issue lies in operator precedence and the way PHP interprets the expression.

```php
$myArray = [ 'a' => 1, 'b' => (true ? 2 : 3) ];
```

This code seems straightforward, aiming to assign 2 to the key 'b' because the condition `true` is met. However, if you have a more complex expression, you might run into unexpected results.

```php
$myArray = [ 'a' => 1, 'b' => (true ? 2 + 3 : 3 * 2) ]; // Incorrect precedence
```

In the second example, you'd expect 'b' to have the value 5.  But due to operator precedence, the expression may not be evaluated as intended leading to unexpected results. 

Another subtle error can occur when using the ternary operator with functions that could potentially return null or false values.

```php
$result = someFunction() ? someFunction() : 'default';
```

This code may execute `someFunction()` twice. If `someFunction()` has side effects or is expensive this can create unforeseen issues.
